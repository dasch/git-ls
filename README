git-ls
======

This small project aims to provide a simplified `git-ls-files`, in the form of
`git-ls`. This command will work more like the normal UNIX `ls`. Its output
is meant for human consumption, and shows by default all versioned files and
directories in the current directory. A "versioned directory" here means a
directory which contains versioned files.
